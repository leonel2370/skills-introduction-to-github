After studying computer networks at university, I discovered a true passion for two fields that drive me every day: coding and cybersecurity.

I'm actively learning how to build web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular. On the server side, I’m working with Python and Java.

What I’m looking for is the balance between creating (development) and protecting (security). I want to build systems that are not only functional and useful, but also strong and resilient against threats.

For me, a good IT professional doesn’t just make things work — they understand, optimize, and most importantly, secure them..
